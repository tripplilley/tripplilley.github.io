            <h2>Career Summary</h2>
            <p>
              As a general technologist, I&apos;ve acquired an expansive body of
              skills, experience, and knowledge of technologies,
              methodologies, and problem domains. I&apos;ve delved deeply into the
              unique problems of, and principle technologies behind:

            </ul>

            <p>
              Since my start in the industry in 1989, I&apos;ve dedicated myself to
              understanding problem domains, technologies, and the human
              factors issues that bridge those two worlds. In the intervening
              decade and a half of work, I&apos;ve acquired a unique and thorough
              blend of experiences with systems, solutions, and the business
              problems to which the they apply.

                  Designed and built XOS, an OpenWrt-based embedded

                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed and developed a single-file XOS image,
                  featuring the easy field upgrade process of an

                  In support of <em>KATHMANDU</em> work,
                  refined the Perl Prototype library, and added an implicit
                  persistence framework. Made prototype objects
                  semi-transparently persistent against an RDBMS backend.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Designed and implemented low-level driver and
                  communications / database library for PC based
                  configuration of PointGuard Access Control and Alarm
                  panels (based on Echelon LonWorks technology). This
                  backend library was the basis for a colleague's Windows
                  UI.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed and implemented UI for PC based configuration of
                  the RCC/DDC series of alarm panels (MC68k-based embedded
                  systems). This involved building a C++ database engine to
                  run out of ROM on the 68k board. That means I know what an
                  <em>&ldquo;in-place new&rdquo;</em> is.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed and built GPIB and embedded-systems based
                  automated test equipment for components in the Longbow
                  targeting system on the Apache helicopter. Discovered,
                  analysed, and solved discrepancies in the timing
                  assumptions made by the original designs. This project
                  involved hardware design (around the Motorola 68HC11 8-bit
                  microcontroller and the North Atlantic Angle Position
                  Indicator), MC68HC11 assembler, a C++ OLE Automation
                  object to manipulate the GPIB and HC11 based systems, and
                  a radically forward VB UI.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed and implemented a Java <em>(Swing)</em> UI and
                  test &ldquo;harness&rdquo; for automated test
                  equipment. Included Jython for scriptability.
