            <h2>Career Summary</h2>
            <p>
              As a general technologist, I&apos;ve acquired an expansive body of
              skills, experience, and knowledge of technologies,
              methodologies, and problem domains. I&apos;ve delved deeply into the
              unique problems of, and principle technologies behind:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Systems support and infrastructure for software development and deployment</li>
              <li>Digital Multimedia, graphic design and prepress</li>
              <li>Network design, deployment, and operations (including network security)</li>
              <li>Accounting (of assets, inventory, debts, transactions, and time)</li>
              <li>Content- and Asset-management for web-based publication</li>
              <li>Workflow and digital document management</li>
              <li>Premises security (i.e., alarms, locks, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Since my start in the industry in 1989, I&apos;ve dedicated myself to
              understanding problem domains, technologies, and the human
              factors issues that bridge those two worlds. In the intervening
              decade and a half of work, I&apos;ve acquired a unique and thorough
              blend of experiences with systems, solutions, and the business
              problems to which the solutions apply.

            <h2>Functional Summary</h2>
            <p>
              I&apos;ve been a software developer, systems and infrastructure
              architect, and general technologist, de facto human factors
              consultant, graphic designer, and support technician. I
              understand technology from the lowest levels to the highest, and
              am comfortable operating at any and all of those levels.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have exceptional talents for:

            <p>
              I have specific skills in, and passions for:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Infrastructure software (i.e., software in support of other technological ends)</li>

            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p class="groupdesc">
              I list these in three groups. In the first group are those
              languages in which I have achieved mastery and worked
              &ldquo;deep black magic.&rdquo; I list them in reverse
              chronological order of my initial experience with them (which
              roughly approximates the order of my mastery and adoption of
              each of them as my language of choice, although in several cases
              there is significant overlap.)
            </p>

            <ul class="group">
              <li>Python</li>

              <li>Java</li>
              <li>MC68HC11 Assembly</li>

              <li>C++</li>
              <li>C</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="groupdesc">
              In the second group are those languages with which I have
              achieved familiarity and the ability to accomplish functional
              work, but have not had occasion or specific reason to explore in
              more depth. I list these in reverse order of my skill level with
              them (greatest to least.)
            </p>

            <ul class="group">
              <li>Jython <em>(Python implemented in Java)</em></li>
              <li>Emacs LISP / LISP / AutoLISP</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="groupdesc">
              In the third group are those languages with which I have a
              conceptual familiarity and have written &ldquo;toy&rdquo;
              programs to exercise concepts, but have not written significant
              code, or even short, task-specific programs. I group these
              (roughly) by language type:
            </p>

            <ul class="group">
              <li>Self, CLOS, Prolog</li>

            <h3>Other Languages</h3>
            <p class="groupdesc">
              These are purpose-specific languages which, even when
              <em>Turing-complete</em>, are narrow in their scope. I group
              these (roughly) by type and purpose, but the groups are
              otherwise unordered.
